# Limitations of testing by example

- Just the examples the programmer come up with

```
assert.equal(5, sum(2, 3))
assert.equal(5, sum(1, 4))
```

# Limitations of testing by example

- Just the examples the programmer come up with

```
assert.equal(5, sum(2, 3))
assert.equal(5, sum(1, 4))

function sum(x,y) {
  return 5;
}
```

# Limitations of testing by example

- Too many combinations

  - submitBid -> submitBid -> presalePayment -> submitBid ...
  - presalePayment -> submitBid -> presalePayment ...
  - submitBid -> wait -> wait -> submitBid ...
  - wait -> submitBid -> [...] -> presalePayment -> submitBid
---

# Property-based testing

- Generators: generate random input
- Run: Verify that property holds true on every input
- Shrink: Find the smallest input that still fails

---

# Smart contracts

- State
  - stage: Stopped / Running / Finished
  - bids: [{account: xyz, tokens: 42, price: 2.7}, ...]
  - presalePayments: [{account: abc, ether: 4}, {...}]
  - ...

---

# Stateful Property-based testing

- Generate sequence of transactions
- Apply transactions on the smart contracts
- Compare actual state to expected state
- Find the shortest sequence that still fails
  - wait -> wait -> wait -> wait -> submitBid

---

# How to find properties

- Mathematical
  ```
  a + b == b + a // commutative
  ```
- Round tripping / inverse
  ```
  s == fromJSON(toJSON(s))
  ```
- Idempotence 
  ```
  update(user) == update(update(user))
  ```
- Function equality
  ```
  sort(arr) == fastSort(arr)
  ```
